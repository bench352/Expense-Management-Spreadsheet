# Expense Management Spreadsheet
Expense Management Spreadsheet is a macro-embedded Excel spreadsheet that I created for managing my expenses, savings, and inventory. You can use it to help manage your expense if you find it useful.

This spreadsheet is pre-filled with sample (i.e. fake) data to preserve the Excel formulas used for calculations. Feel free to delete those data and fill in your data instead.

You can use it by downloading and opening [Expense Management.xlsm](Expense%20Management.xlsm).

> **FYI:** If you find the price in the sample data "outrageous", it is because the price is originally in HKD.

## Features

- Different sheets for managing regular expenses
- "Day-off Spending" sheet for recording expenses in day-offs (which has higher spending than initially estimated)
- "Inventory" sheet for recoding information of items bought
- "Monthly Expense Calculator" that automatically calculates total expense based on the input in other sheets

- "Fund Management Tool" for managing savings for different purposes

You can refer to the [User Guide](Documentation/User%20Guide.md) to learn how to use this spreadsheet to record and manage your expenses.
